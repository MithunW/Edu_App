He is regarded as one of the modern greats of batsmanship, specially due to his mastery of playing spin bowling. Jayawardene\\'s highest test score, 374 against South Africa is the highest test score by a right handed batsman in the history of test cricket. It is also regarded as the highest absolutely chance-less innings by a batsman in test cricket history.\\nJayawardene made his Test cricket debut in 1997 and his One Day International (ODI) debut the following season. In 2006 he made the highest ever score by a Sri Lankan in Test cricket, scoring 374 in the second Test of Sri Lanka\\'s home series against South Africa. He has a test cricket average of over 50 and a One Day average in the 30s. He is the first player in the history of Sri Lankan cricket to score over 10,000 Test runs. Despite his relatively low ODI average, Jayawardene is considered to be one of the best batsmen produced by Sri Lanka.\\nHe is one of only four Sri Lankans—the others being Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan—to have the prestigious record of having scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs. Along with teammate Sangakkara, he recorded for the most partnership runs for the 3rd wicket in Tests, scoring 5890 runs surpassing 5826 run stand of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, during the first test match against Pakistan at Galle International Stadium, which was his last test at the venue. He scored 56 runs at that match, where his counterpart scored 221 runs.\\nJayawardene was a key member of the team that won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and was part of the team that made to the final of 2007 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC World Twenty20.\\nIn 2006, Jayawardene was named by the International Cricket Council as the best international captain of the year and was nominated in 2007 as the best Test cricket player of the year. He is also known for his fielding skills in the inner ring, with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had affected the most number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the fifth highest run-out/match ratio in ODI\\'s. Statistics also reveal that c Jayawardene b Muralitharan is the most common bowler-fielder combination in the history of Test cricket.\\nJayawardene is currently working as an international TV commentator with the first test at Headingley on 19 May 2016 between England and Sri Lanka.Career\\n \\nEarly and domestic career\\n \\nJayawardene was educated at one of the most prestigious schools of Sri Lanka, Nalanda College Colombo. At an early age Mahela\\'s father, Senerath Jayawardene, introduced him to the Lionel Coaching Clinic run by Nondescripts Cricket Club in Cinnamon Gardens. It was there that he learned to play cricket. Jayawardene captained Nalanda College Colombo first XI cricket team in 1994. He developed his talents through the school cricket team, eventually becoming captain. He was runner-up for the best schoolboy cricketer award during the 1994 cricketing season.\\n \\nDomestically he has played for Sinhalese Sports Club since 1995. He was signed to play as an overseas player for Derbyshire for the first half of the 2008 English cricket season. However, his commitments to Sri Lanka and involvement in the Indian Premier League prevented him from playing any part in the 2008 county season.\\n  \\nInternational career\\n \\nCareer in the 1990s\\n \\nMahela Jayawardene is the 69th Sri Lanka Test Cap, having made his debut against India at Colombo in 1997. Jayawardene made his Test debut in the record breaking Test in 1997 against India at R.P.S., Colombo. Jayawardene added 66 to Sri Lanka\\'s first innings score of 952/6, the highest Test score ever. He was at the crease when the previous highest Test score was surpassed. Early in his career he scored 167 against New Zealand and 242 against India.\\n \\nJayawardene\\'s One Day International debut was against Zimbabwe at Premadasa in January 1998. Sri Lanka won the match, with Jayawardene hitting the winning run. In the next game Jayawardene scored 74. It took only 11 matches before he scored his first century, which was against England in the Carlton and United World Series game at Adelaide. Jayawardene entered a pressure situation, with Sri Lanka struggling at 134/4 in the run chase, but made an innings of 120 runs to win the match. The match is notable for Ross Emerson\\'s no-balling of Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing, which led the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead his team to the edge of the field and consider walking out of the match, as well as physical shoulder-barging by some players.\\n \\nCaptaincy\\n \\nJayawardene was the captain of the Sri Lankan national team during the England tour in 2006 in the absence of Marvan Atapattu. He led his team to 1–1 draw in the Test series and an emphatic 5–0 whitewash in the ODI series.\\n \\n \\n \\nJayawardene\\'s results in international matches\\n \\n \\n \\n\\xa0\\n \\nMatches\\n \\nWon\\n \\nLost\\n \\nDrawn\\n \\nTied\\n \\nNo result\\n \\n \\n \\nTest\\n \\n149\\n \\n58\\n \\n46\\n \\n45\\n \\n0\\n \\n–\\n \\n \\n \\nODI\\n \\n448\\n \\n241\\n \\n186\\n \\n–\\n \\n3\\n \\n17\\n \\n \\n \\nT20I\\n \\n55\\n \\n37\\n \\n17\\n \\n–\\n \\n1\\n \\n–\\n \\n \\n \\nIn the first Test of the 2006 Test series against South Africa, Jayawardene shared a world record partnership of 624 runs alongside Kumar Sangakkara. This partnership, the highest for any wicket in first-class cricket history, and the first instance of a stand of 600 or more in a first-class or Test match innings, smashed the previous third wicket stand for Sri Lanka, surpassing 262 which involved himself along with Thilan Samaraweera. It also broke the previous record for the third wicket partnership for all Test playing nations surpassing the 467 run partnership made by the New Zealanders Martin Crowe and Andrew Jones.\\n \\nJayawardene became the first Sri Lankan captain to score a Test triple-century, making 374 off 572 deliveries with 43 fours and 1 six, the fourth highest individual innings score in Test match cricket and the highest by a right-hander. He is also the first batsman to pass 350 in a Test without going on to break the world record. He also surpassed the highest score by a Sri Lankan in a Test match, previously held by Sanath Jayasuriya\\'s 340 in 1997 against India, coincidentally also produced in a world record partnership.\\n \\nHe was also chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2007. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Jayawardene scored one century and four half-centuries and was the second highest run-scorer of the tournament, which was topped by Australia\\'s Matthew Hayden. The century he scored against New Zealand helped Sri Lanka win the Semi-Final. Sri Lanka finished runners-up in the World Cup losing to Australia in the final. He is the only batsman in World Cup ODI history to score hundreds in both a semi final and a final of the tournament. He achieved this feat, by scoring a century in 2007 Cricket World Cup semi final against New Zealand, and a century in 2011 Cricket World Cup final against India.\\n \\nHe has scored centuries against all Test-playing nations. He achieved this feat on the 21st February 2009 by scoring his maiden Test century against Pakistan at the National Stadium in Karachi, Pakistan.\\n \\nJayawardene is the recipient of International Cricket Council\\'s \"Captain of the Year 2006\", Captain of the \"World One-Day International Team of the Year 2006\", Wisden Cricketer of the Year 2007, and the record holder for the highest score (374 runs) by a Sri Lankan in Test cricket. He also led Sri Lanka when the team won the \"Spirit of Cricket Award\" in 2007 and 2008.\\n \\nJayawardene led Sri Lanka to Pakistan for a Test series in March–April 2009. The series was conducted after the Indian team withdrew from playing in Pakistan, following the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The first Test ended in a draw, even though he scored a double century in the first Test. Sri Lanka was in a good position in the Test with Thilan Samaraweera hitting his second successive double hundred of the series and Tillakaratne Dilshan scoring a century.\\n \\nOn their way to the Gaddafi Stadium for the third day\\'s play, the bus that carried the Sri Lankan players was fired at by 12 masked gunmen. Jayawardene, along with six other Sri Lankan cricketers, sustained injuries. Six policemen who guarded the bus and two civilians were killed in the attack.\\n \\nJayawardene was appointed vice-captain of the Sri Lankan team once again under Kumar Sangakkara after Muttiah Muralitharan retired from test cricket, but resigned after the team\\'s World Cup defeat. He was appointed as captain again after Tillakaratne Dilshan resigned from the captaincy in 2012. He was the captain of Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the Indian Premier Leagueand the Delhi Daredevils. He won the Spirit of Cricket Award 2013.\\n \\nPost-captaincy\\n \\nHowever, he regained some form during the IPL 2010. Before starting their chase of 201 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders, Jayawardene expressed his desire to open the innings to captain Kumar Sangakkara. Sangakkara agreed to his fellow countrymate and Jayawardene scored a blazing 110* off just 59 balls winning them the match in the second last over. Sangakkara, impressed by his teammate set him as opener for the Kings XI Punjab. He scored a few more entertaining knocks in vain including 44 against the Rajasthan Royals and 93* against the Deccan Chargers. He ended the tournament with a batting average of 43.90. He was the 6th highest run scorer for the tournament and highest for the Kings XI Punjab.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Jayawardene batting in a Test match for Sri Lanka in 2008\\n \\n \\n \\nWith Kumar Sangakkara as the Sri Lankan Captain too, Jaywardene was sent as opener for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. In the first match against New Zealand, he scored 81 off just 51 balls. However, this knock went in vain due to the collapse in the Sri Lankan batting line-up after his wicket fell which resulted in a total of only 135 on board batting first. However, in his very next match against Zimbabwe, he scored 100 of just 64 balls helping them win the match helping them win the match defending a total of 173. He thus became the 4th player to score a century in an Twenty20 International match and the first Sri Lankan to do so. Sri Lanka won the match by D/L method. In the very next match against West Indies, he scored 98* off just 56 balls narrowly missing his second century in a row. This became his third consecutive score above 80.\\n \\nDuring the second Test of Sri Lanka\\'s tour of South Africa in 2011–12, Jayawardene became the ninth player in cricket history, and the first Sri Lankan, to score 10,000 Test runs. At the end of the tour he was reappointed as Sri Lanka\\'s captain, following the resignation of Tillakaratne Dilshan.\\n \\nJayawardene led Sri Lanka to the final of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 against the West Indies on home turf. Having restricted the Windies to 137/6, Sri Lanka were steadily making progress in chasing down the target with Jayawardene well set. Halfway through their innings, captain Jayawardene noticed that the West Indies were slightly ahead on Duckworth/Lewis with a hint of rain in the air. He subsequently decided to accelerate the innings, but this only triggered a collapse. The rain never came and Sri Lanka fell a long way short of the target. He resigned as Sri Lanka\\'s T20 captain after the match and in 2014 also announced his retirement from T20 cricket.\\n \\nHe holds the record for most number of catches in ODIs, taking 218 catches in 448 matches. matches.\\n \\nHe also holds the record for the most runs in a Twenty20 World Cup Career having scored 858 runs in 25 innings, at an average of 40.8 runs per inning, in the four ICC World Twenty20 tournaments held to date (2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012).\\n \\nOn 31 March 2016 it was announced that Jayawaradene has signed for Somerset County Cricket to represent them in the English T20 league. \\n \\nRetirement\\n \\nOn 25 February 2014 in an Asia Cup fixture against Pakistan, Jayawardene became only the second cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar to appear in 600 international matches.\\n \\nOn 14 July 2014, Jayawardene announced his retirement from Test cricket after the 2014 Pakistan series. He played his final Test at his favourite ground, the Sinhalese Sports Club, where he scored 54 runs in his last test innings. The ground was replete with thousands of tributes. Russell Arnold quipped that \\nLegends never retire\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Jayawardene bowling vs England in his final ODI in Sri Lanka\\n \\n \\n \\nHis last One-Day innings in Sri Lanka was played on 13 December 2014 in the last match of England ODI series. He was caught on 28 in his last innings on home soil. Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews gave him the ball to take the final wicket. He got his 8th ODI wicket by dismissing James Tredwell through a stumping, with Sangakkara behind the stumps.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Jayawardene batting vs England in his final ODI in Sri Lanka\\n \\n \\n \\nOn 11 January 2015, he scored his 18th ODI century against New Zealand. This was his first ODI century in New Zealand in his 17-year-long ODI career.\\n \\nDuring a match against Australia at the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, Jayawardene became the most capped player for Sri Lanka in ODIs, passing Jayasuriya\\'s 445 ODI matches.\\n \\nJayawardene\\'s last ODI was the quarter final of the 2015 World Cup, played against South Africa. He only scored 4 runs and Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the semi-finals for the first time since 1999.\\n Personal life\\n \\nJayawardene was born to Sunila and Senerath Jayawardene at Colombo in 1977. He had one younger brother, Dhishal who died of a brain tumour, aged 16. This affected Jayawardene psychologically, halting his cricket career for some time. Eventually he was persuaded to go on and set about rebuilding his career by his parents and teammates.\\n \\nJayawardene is married to Christina Mallika Sirisena, a travel consultant. They have a daughter.\\n Charity works\\n \\nOff the field, he has won praise for his personal contribution to the HOPE cancer project. With memories of his deceased brother in mind, he became the leading campaigner of HOPE. Now, with the support of his team-mates, he aims to build a new 750-bed cancer unit at Maharagama, the country\\'s only dedicated cancer hospital.\\n \\nThe first cancer Trail was walked in 2011, but due to cricket tours, he couldn\\'t participate to the walk. The walk began in the South and ended in the North with US$2.6 million, with the contribution of 30,000 people walked in the Trail. With the money, government build a 120-bed Tellippalai Trail Cancer Hospital in Jaffna.\\n \\nIn 2016, Jayawardene accompany with Sangakkara started a charity walkathon called \\nTrail as One\\n for raising money for a cancer hospital, which was the second trail after 2011. The walk started on 6 October 2016 from Point Pedro and finished at Dondra Head on 2 November 2016, which was 28-days 670 kilometres walk. Many other former and current Sri Lankan cricketers joined by each destination to the walk and the walk ended successfully with around US$5 million of money from all over the country. The money was given to expand the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital oncology unit in Galle.\\n Coaching career\\n \\nIn August 2015, the England Cricket Board signed Jayawardene as batting consultant for the England team. He accepted the role and he was a part of the England coaching team travelling to the UAE for the series against Pakistan in October, up to the World Twenty20 in India.\\n Product and brand endorsements\\n \\n \\nMobitel (Sri Lanka)\\n \\nDSI holdings Ltd.\\n \\nReebok – \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\"Mobitel\\'s all-encompassing registration system: a success story\"\\n. \\nhttp://www.businesstoday.lk\\n.

He was educated at the S. Thomas' College in Mount Lavinia. After captaining the school team and being selected as best schoolboy batsman of the year, Tennekoon went on to play first-class cricket for the Ceylon team (later Sri Lanka). He was regarded as an accomplished batsman. He made his ODI debut in 1975 against West Indies, leading Sri Lanka in the first Cricket World Cup of 1975. went on to lead them in the 1979 World Cup as well, although his participation was impeded by an injury during the tournament.\\nHe was the chief executive of Sri Lanka Cricket from 2000 to 2003, and is now a selector for the national team.Personal life and early career\\n \\nAnura Punchi Banda Tennekoon was born in Anuradhapura. At the age of six, he moved to Colombo, and was admitted to S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Staying at the school hostel, Tennekoon was soon accustomed with cricket, and became part of the school cricket team. He eventually went on to captain the Thomian cricket team, and was chosen as Sri Lanka's best schoolboy batsman in 1964. He had had the best batting average of 56.84 in the previous season, having scored a total of 513 runs. He played his first first-class match for Ceylon against an English side in 1966, and was later picked up by the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC). Tennekoon also played for the Ceylon Board President's XI. He made his career's highest score in a first class match against India in 1974, hitting an unbeaten 169. This is regarded as one of the best centuries scored by a Sri Lankan batsman before the country gained Test status.\\n International career\\n \\nTennekoon was the ninth ODI cap for Sri Lanka, and played four One Day International (ODI) matches, leading the Sri Lankan side in all of them. Tennekoon captained the Sri Lankan cricket team at the inaugural Cricket World Cup of 1975, during which he played his first three ODIs. The first match was played against the West Indies on 7 June 1975, ended in defeat for Sri Lanka who managed to score only 86 runs. Tennekoon too was unsuccessful in this match, having been caught by David Murray off the bowling of Bernard Julien without scoring. The Sri Lankan team played their second match of the tournament against Australia on 11 June 1975. They lost the match, but Tennekoon was more successful this time – he scored 48 runs off 71 deliveries, before being bowled out by Ian Chappell just two runs short of his double century. According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Tennekoon and teammate Michael Tissera batted without being intimidated by the Australian fast bowling attack despite two of their teammates having to retire after being injured. Sri Lanka's third and last match in the tournament was against Pakistan on 14 June 1975. Tennekoon made 30 runs for his team, but Pakistan easily defeated Sri Lanka.\\n \\nTennekoon's fourth and final ODI was against New Zealand on 9 June 1979, as part of the 1979 Cricket World Cup. He made the highest score and only half-century of his ODI career during this match, making 59 runs off 96 deliveries before being bowled out by Warren Stott. Later, he damaged a hamstring during practices and could not play for the rest of the tournament. He was replaced as captain by Bandula Warnapura. Sri Lanka received full member status of the International Cricket Council in 1982, two years after Tennekoon's retirement. The achievements of Sri Lankan players like Tennekoon may have contributed to this.\\n Cricket administration\\n \\nAfter his retirement from the game, Tennekoon has functioned as the manager of the Sri Lanka A cricket team. He was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Sri Lanka Cricket, the governing body for cricket in Sri Lanka, in December 2000. He held the position until late 2003, when he resigned due to personal reasons. In 2009, Tennekoon was appointed to the selection committee for the national cricket team.\\n \"}, {'cricketerName': 'Arjuna Ranatunga', 'bio': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Intro': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer Politician ', 'From': ' Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Politics Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  1 December 1963, Gampaha ', 'Age': '57 years', 'paragraph': 'Deshamanya Arjuna Ranatunga (Sinhalese: අර්ජුන රණතුංග; born 1 December 1963) is a Sri Lankan politician, former international cricketer and cricket administrator. He captained the Sri Lankan cricket team in the 1990s, and lead them in the 1996 Cricket World Cup victory.\\nA specialist left-handed batsman and part-time medium pace bowler, Ranatunga\\'s career with the Sri Lankan national team began in 1982, when Sri Lanka were relative newcomers to international cricket and was a key player in the team. Under Ranatunga\\'s captaincy, Sri Lanka started to improve rapidly. Their growing success rate culminated with a dominating performance and triumphed in the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Although some of his actions caused some controversy, Ranatunga was praised for his leadership in raising a team long regarded as underdogs to the status of world champions.\\nUpon retirement from playing cricket he entered politics, joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and entered parliament, from Colombo District, in the 2001 elections. He served a tenure as deputy minister for tourism, and also served as the president of Sri Lanka Cricket until December 2008. He joined the Democratic National Alliance in 2010 and contested the 2010 elections. In 2015 General elections he contested with the United National Front for Good Governance and placed 2nd in Gampaha District, and was appointed Minister of Ports and Shipping.\\nHe was awarded the title Deshamanya by the Sri Lankan Government in 1996 after he led the Sri Lanka to victory in the World Cup.Early life\\n \\nRanatunga comes from Minuwangoda, a town twenty miles north of Colombo. His father Reggie Ranatunga, was a politician. He, along with his brothers, studied at Ananda College Colombo where his mother was a teacher and where he started playing cricket. He represented his school in both junior and senior teams. He has five brothers, Dammika Ranatunga, Nishantha Ranatunga, Prasanna Ranatunga, Sanjeeva Ranatunga and Ruwan Ranatunga; where himself, Nishantha, Sanjeeva, and Dhammika all played for Sri Lanka national cricket team in different times, Prasanna, Ruwan and himself moved to politics.\\n  \\nCricket career\\n \\nFirst-class and Test debuts\\n \\nA left-handed batsman and useful right arm medium pace bowler, Ranatunga made his first-class debut in 1981 at the age of eighteen and a year later played in Sri Lanka\\'s inaugural Test match. In this match he became the first Sri Lankan to score a Test half century.\\n \\nCaptaincy\\n \\nRanatunga went on to captain Sri Lanka in 1988, taking control of the national team for the next 11 years, transforming it from a weak, routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit. He led the team to their greatest cricketing triumph, 1996 World Cup. His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team, given little chance prior to the competition, for cricket\\'s greatest prize. His strategies was commended by many cricketing greats and followed by other teams. He was the brain behind the strategy of scoring as many runs as possible in the first 15 overs of an ODI match in which there are field restrictions. This strategy was perfectly executed by Sanath Jayasuriya. This strategy was still followed by the batsmen in the Powerplays. He was widely recognised as a belligerent leader and was famous for defending his players at all costs regardless of what they did.\\n \\n1996 World Cup\\n \\nThe Sri Lankan national team were considered perpetual underdogs but this image changed completely during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, when Sri Lanka defeated tournament favourites Australia to win it under the captaincy of Ranatunga. This victory, for which Ranatunga was a pivotal part both as batsman and captain, started a new era of Sri Lankan competitiveness on the global stage; they had previously never passed the group stage of a world cup.\\n \\nRetirement\\n \\nRanatunga lost the national team captaincy in 1999 after Sri Lanka\\'s poor showing at the World Cup in England, although he was chosen as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for that year.\\n \\nIn June 2000, Ranatunga played in Sri Lanka\\'s 100th Test match, becoming the only player to represent his country in their first and hundredth Test. He retired from playing cricket in 2001.\\n  \\nControversies\\n \\nFitness\\n \\nRanatunga\\'s weight was also notable for being considered excessive for a professional athlete. It gave rise to an incident during a game played in humid conditions when he called for a runner, claiming that he had \"sprained something\"; opposition (Australian) wicket-keeper Ian Healy responded with an insulting comment, falling under what is categorized in cricket as a \"sledge\", which was picked up by the stump microphones and broadcast live on television. Ranatunga was known for controversially calling a runner during long innings due to his level of fitness. After the second final of the One Day triangular series in Australia in the 1995/6 season, when the incident with Healy occurred, Ranatunga instructed his players not to shake the Australian players\\' hands. During this match, Sanath Jayasuriya and Australian paceman Glenn McGrath were also involved in physical jostling; Jayasuriya accused McGrath of racially abusing him, a claim that the bowler denied.\\n \\nDefence of Muralitharan\\n \\nRanatunga is also remembered for his stand in a One Day International against England. Australian Umpire Ross Emerson called Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing. (Muralitharan was subsequently cleared by bio-mechanical experts hired by the ICC.) Ranatunga exchanged heated words with umpire Emerson and led his team to a point just inside the boundary line, halting play and giving the impression that he was about to forfeit the match, until the Sri Lankan management conferred with him and play resumed. English captain, Alec Stewart, was openly critical of Ranatunga\\'s behaviour. In a comment caught on the stump microphone he was heard to say to Ranatunga \"Your conduct today has been appalling for a country\\'s captain\". The match was bad-tempered, with instances of shoulder-bumping.\\n \\nWrangles with Warne\\n \\nHe is noted also for his repeated intense criticism of the Australian team, especially his long-standing rivalry with Shane Warne. During the 1996 World Cup, Ranatunga claimed that Warne was overrated, and during the final, Warne misexecuted a flipper, which turned into a full toss. Ranatunga pulled it over the boundary for the six and then stuck his tongue out at Warne. During the 1999 World Cup, Warne wrote a column calling Ranatunga a \"disgrace\". The Sri Lankan shot back by referring to his country\\'s cultural heritage and then mocking Australia over convict settlement.\\n \\nIn 2005, Warne mocked Ranatunga\\'s rotund figure, which had become more ample since his retirement, suggesting that he had swallowed a sheep.\\n \\nThere has always been between Warne and Ranatunga a grudging mutual admiration. When the former visited Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami to aid Muralitharan in his \"great work\" there, he developed an amiable rapport with his long-time foe: \"We even wagged,\" he confirmed later. Not long after, however, Ranatunga was lambasting him in a scathing newspaper attack.\\n \\n\"You can\\'t be mates with everyone,\" Warne wrote in his 2008 book \\nShane Warne\\'s Century\\n, serialised by \\nThe Times\\n in September, \"and if there was any way I could knock him down to number 101 for the purposes of this book, I\\'d be delighted to do so. But having taken on the task, I want to do it seriously, and the fact is that Ranatunga helped to put Sri Lanka on the cricket map. And you know what? Deep down, I\\'ll quietly admit that I rated him as a cricketer.\"\\n Career highlights\\n \\n \\nTests\\n \\n \\nTest debut: vs England, Colombo, 1981–1982\\n Last Test: vs South Africa, Colombo, 2000–2001\\n \\n \\nRanatunga\\'s highest Test batting score of 135 not out was made against Pakistan, Colombo, 1985–1986\\n \\nHis best Test bowling effort of 2 for 17 came against New Zealand, Kandy, 1983–1984\\n \\nRanatunga\\'s captaincy record was as follows: 56 matches, 12 wins, 19 losses, 25 draws.\\n \\n \\n \\nOne-day Internationals\\n \\n \\nODI Debut: vs England, Colombo, 1981–1982\\n Last ODI: vs Kenya, Southampton, 1999 World Cup\\n \\n \\nHis highest ODI batting score of 131 not out was made against India, Colombo, 1997\\n \\nRanatunga\\'s best bowling figures of 4 for 14 came against India at Kanpur in 1986–1987\\n \\nHis captaincy record was as follows: 193 matches, 89 wins, 95 losses, 1 tie, 8 no result\\n \\nUntil New Zealand\\'s Stephen Fleming overtook him in October 2006 at the ICC Champions Trophy, Ranatunga held the record for captaining the most ODI matches.\\n \\n \\nCareer centuries\\n \\n \\nTest centuries\\n \\n \\nThe following table illustrates a summary of the Test centuries scored by Arjuna Ranatunga\\n \\n \\nthe column \\n, * indicates being \\nnot out\\n \\nThe column title \\nMatch\\n refers to the \\nMatch Number\\n of the player\\'s career\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTest Centuries of Arjuna Ranatunga\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRuns\\n \\nMatch\\n \\nAgainst\\n \\nCity/Country\\n \\nVenue\\n \\nYear\\n \\n \\n \\n[1]\\n \\n111\\n \\n10\\n \\n\\xa0\\nIndia\\n \\nColombo, Sri Lanka\\n \\nSinhalese Sports Club Ground\\n \\n1985\\n \\n \\n \\n[2]\\n \\n135*\\n \\n18\\n \\n\\xa0\\nPakistan\\n \\nColombo, Sri Lanka\\n \\nP.

In 2010, Ranatunga leftthe UPFA and joined the Democratic Party of the DNA led by Sarath Fonseka, and was made the deputy leader of the Democratic Party. On November 2012, he resigned from the Democratic Party, but continued his affiliation with DNA.

He is known as the \"mystery spinner\" due to the unusual bowling action and widely regarded as one of the best Twenty20 bowlers in the world arena. As a batsman he has proven to be a useful tailender, scoring one Test fifty.Mendis made his One Day International debut against the West Indies at Port of Spain in 2008 and took 3 for 39. He also plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League.His first Test Match was against India at Colombo on 23 July 2008 in which he returned match figures of 8–132, thereby becoming the first Sri Lankan bowler to get an eight-wicket haul on Test debut. Mendis won the Emerging Player of the Year award at the LG ICC Awards ceremony held in Dubai in September 2008.Until February 2017, he was the only bowler to have taken six wickets in a Twenty20 International, and he has achieved the feat twice, claiming the world record figures of 6 wickets for 8 runs for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe on 18 September 2012. On 26 October 2012 Ajantha Mendis received the Sri Lankan order of Bantu, the highest civilian honour in Sri Lanka.Early years and personal lifeBorn on 11 March 1985, Mendis hails from a hamlet in Moratuwa. He is the third child in a family of five with an elder brother and a sister. He was raised Catholic. He has had his basic education at St Anthony\\'s College at Kadalana in his village where there were no facilities at all for sports. He subsequently entered Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya in the year of 2000. During a cricket coaching class, Mendis\\' talents were initially identified by the school coach named Mr Lucky Rogers back in the year 1998 when he was just 13 years of age. In the year 2000 he represented the school under 15 cricket team and he was selected to the first eleven team. He also deputised for the school team captain. This slow medium bowler with a variation of leg spin was adjudged the Best Bowler at the big-matches twice in 2001 and 2002.Military careerSri Lanka Artillery Cricket Committee noticed his talents when he played a cricket match against the Army under 23 Division 11 during 2003/2004 tournaments. Following this he was invited to enlist in the regular force of the Sri Lanka Army, this was particularly due to the low number of cricketers from Colombo schools joining the Army in the recent years. He enlisted, partly due to the reason that his father, the bread-winner for the family had died the week before due to a heart attack.Following basic training he played for the army team and saw active military service as a Gunner in the Sri Lanka Artillery, a regiment of the Sri Lanka Army. Following the Asia Cup final, he has been promoted to the rank of Sergeant on 7 July 2008 and the next day commissioned as a Second Lieutenant.Domestic cricketMendis has represented the Army in 23 limited over matches and 59 two/three-day matches, in which he has 38 wickets and 244 wickets respectively to his credit. Mendis bowls off spin as his stock delivery and he has few more variations in his armoury- leg spin, top spin and faster bowl. All this was developed during 2006/2007 domestic seasons on his own. He also extended his purple patch in the domestic season 2007/2008 under 23 division 1 tournament and was later selected to the pool of \"Academy Squad\" organised by Sri Lanka Cricket. There he was able to polish his cricketing skills further. He had the opportunity of touring neighbouring India on an eight-day tour in June 2007 where he was given the opportunity to play two, two-day matches. In the meantime, Sri Lanka Cricket selectors could not ignore his performance in the Premier Limited Over Tournament 2007/2008 and got him selected to play in the \"Provincial Tournament 2008\" representing \"Wayamba Province\" under the National Captain. In that tournament he performed exceptionally well with the ball. Local TV commentators predicted him as the ideal replacement for senior spinner Muttiah Muralitharan in time to come and nicknamed him as \"Mysterious Bowler\". His performance in the said tournament got the National Selectors to observe him further closely, after he became the most successful bowler by taking 68 wickets in nine matches which is also a record in any form of domestic cricket.In the 2010 County Championship Mendis was to play for Hampshire as their overseas player for the season as a replacement for Imran Tahir, but he was unable to fulfill his contract and never appeared for the county.He now, however, has confirmed that he will be playing for South West side Somerset in the upcoming 2011 English domestic season.At the 2013 Indian Premier League Auctions held in Chennai, India on 3 February 2013, Mendis proved to be one of the most expensive players sold, purchased by the Pune Warriors India for $725,000.Mendis played for Lahore Qalandars in Pakistan Super League held at U.A.E in February 2016.2009 Lahore AttackOn 3 March 2009, the bus that carried the Sri Lankan cricketers to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, for the third day\\'s play of the second Test match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, was fired at by masked gunmen. Mendis was among seven Sri Lankan cricketers who were injured in the attack, which killed five policemen who guarded the bus.International careerTest cricketAjantha Mendis made his debut in Test cricket against India in at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo, on 23 July 2008. He claimed his first Test wicket in his fifth over, bowling Rahul Dravid with a delivery now christened the carrom ball, that turned from middle and hit off stump. He went on to claim the wickets of Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan & VVS Laxman to finish with figures of 4 for 72 in his maiden test bowling performance. He followed this up with 4 for 60 in India\\'s second innings. Ajantha Mendis\\' match figures of \\n8 for 132 are the best by any Sri Lankan bowler on Test debut\\n, bettering Kuruppurachchi\\'s 7 for 85 against Pakistan in 1985–86. After the game Muttiah Muralitharan stated that \"When I started playing Test cricket, I was not as good as Mendis. He is exceptional. He is the future of Sri Lankan cricket,\". Mendis collected his first ten-wicket haul in the very next match, which Sri Lanka went on to lose. With 26 wickets (ave.18.38) in the series, Mendis has passed Alec Bedser\\'s \\nworld record for most wickets by a bowler on his debut in a three-Test series\\n. Ajantha Mendis won the player of the series award for his efforts. On 6 August 2010 during the series against India, Mendis scored his highest Test score of 78.One day internationalsAjantha Mendis made his One Day International debut against West Indies in at the Queen\\'s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 10 April 2008. He announced his arrival on the international stage with three for 39 off 10 overs in this game, and dumbfounded the West Indian batsmen with his range of variations without a perceptible change in his action. Rob Steen summed up the impact of this initial performance by stating \"I have just seen the future of spin bowling – and his name is Ajantha Mendis.\"Ajantha Mendis, playing his eighth ODI, picked up the first six-wicket haul in the Asia Cup final against India in July 2008. His 6 for 13 is the third-best bowling performance in a tournament final, and the third-best for a spinner in ODIs. His 17 wickets is the best for an edition of the Asia Cup, and he bagged those wickets at an astounding average of 8.52. Ajantha Mendis won the man of the match award in the finals as well as the player of the tournament award for his efforts.He has also broken fastest 50 wicket record in ODI, previously held by Ajit Agarkar of India for 23 matches. \\nHe broke the record by snatching 50 wickets in just 19 matches\\n.Mendis was not included to the 2015 Cricket World Cup team and he did not play in the other bilateral series in late 2014 to late 2015. He was included to the ODI and T20I series against West indies in October 2015. He took 2 wickets in the first ODI at R Premadasa Stadium and with these two wickets, he reached 150 ODI wickets, becoming the 8th Sri Lankan to reach that milestone. In the batting, Sri Lanka was in good position to win the game, but with the magical bowling by Sunil Narine, Sri Lanka lost 9 wickets with 21 more runs to win the game. Mendis came on to bat and scored a magnificent 21 runs, guided the team to win the match by 1 wicket. He smashed a huge six to Johnson Charles for a free hit, through long-on to reach his highest ODI score of unbeaten 21 runs. Twenty20 cricketOn 10 October 2008, Ajantha Mendis made his Twenty20 debut against Zimbabwe in King City, Canada. He claimed four for 15 in four overs and won the man of the match award. In the next game he took four wickets for 17 against Canada and went on to take three wickets for 23 in the four-nation series final against Pakistan, helping his side to a five-wicket win. For his remarkable performance of 11 wickets for 55 in just three games, Ajantha Mendis was adjudged the player of the series. In the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England, Mendis was the third highest wicket taker, behind Pakistan\\'s Saeed Ajmal and Umar Gul. He was a contender for Man of the Tournament, but came third behind team mate Tillakaratne Dilshan.Mendis has twice set, and \\ncurrently holds, the record for best figures in a Twenty20 International\\n. On 8 August 2011, he took six wickets for 16 runs in the second Twenty20 international against Australia, becoming the first bowler to take six wickets in a Twenty20 international, and surpassing Umar Gul\\'s five wickets for six runs recorded against New Zealand in 2009. The following year, on 18 September 2012 in the opening match of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 against Zimbabwe, Mendis bettered this record by taking six wickets for eight runs. Up to date, Mendis is the \\nonly bowler to take six wicket hauls in Two Twenty20 internationals.Back InjuryMendis had a severe back injury in second half of 2014. It was like a disc fracture in the back. He has not been able to bowl at all during this period. Now slowly with rest and rehab, he has started to do a bit of running and bowling.Bowling styleMendis, although classified as slow-medium, bowls a mixture of deliveries, including googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks, as well as the carrom ball, released with a flick of his middle finger. For Sri Lanka Army in 2007–08 he averaged a mere 10.56 and took 46 wickets in six games, his strike rate a startling 31. This gained him a call-up to the full Sri Lanka squad for the Caribbean tour in April 2008.The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca wrote in the \\nJamaica Gleaner\\n: \"Mendis bowls everything. With a smile on his face as he caresses the ball before delivering it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen.Jerome Jayaratne, the Sri Lanka Cricket Academy coach, said: \"Mendis is unusual, freaky and has developed a ball which he releases with a snap of his fingers (carrom ball), which is very unusual compared to other orthodox spin bowlers.\" That ball is reminiscent of the former Australia spinner Johnny Gleeson, who had a similar delivery.Although the ball can be made to either turn away or into a right-handed batsman, Mendis uses it to turn away from a right-handed batsman, to contrast it with his off-breaks and googlies. The Australian Test cricketer and coach Peter Philpott actually predicted the rise of a bowler such as Mendis in a book written in 1973.\\n[1]ICC AwardsOn 10 September 2008, Ajantha Mendis has won the \"Emerging Player of the Year\" award at the ICC Awards ceremony in Dubai. Mendis was the top choice of the 25-person Voting Academy, coming in ahead of England\\'s up-and-coming Stuart Broad, South Africa fast bowler Morne Morkel and fast bowler Ishant Sharma of India.The Emerging Player of the Year Award was one of eight individual prizes given at the 2008, ICC Awards.

A wicket-keeper, he made his debut in first-class cricket in 1990, at age of 19. Dassanayake\\'s international debut came in August 1993, against South Africa. He spent just over a year as Sri Lanka\\'s first-choice wicket-keeper, with his last international matches coming on a 1994 tour of New Zealand. In total, Dassanayake represented Sri Lanka in eleven Tests and sixteen One Day International (ODI) matches. His domestic career, which was played mostly for the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club, continued until the 2000–01 season.\\nAfter emigrating to Canada, Dassanayake made his international debut for Canada at the 2005 ICC Trophy. He also represented the team in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the ICC Intercontinental Cup. After his retirement from playing, he was appointed head coach of the national team in August 2007, having earlier spent several months as acting head coach. Dassanayake oversaw Canada\\'s successful qualification for the 2011 World Cup, resigning as coach after the tournament\\'s completion.

Dassanayake was appointed U.S. head coach in September 2016.Playing career\\n \\nSri Lanka\\n \\nDassanayake was born in Kandy, in Sri Lanka\\'s Central Province. A wicket-keeper, he made his first-class debut in January 1990, aged 19, playing for the Colts Cricket Club during the 1989–90 season of the Lakspray Trophy. Dassanayake switched to the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club for the 1990–91 season, but played only a single limited-overs game. He appeared in another four one-day games the following season, playing twice for Bloomfield in the Hatna Trophy and also twice for the Sinhalese Sports Club in the Premadasa Trophy. Beginning in mid-1992, Dassanayake began to be selected for representative teams, playing first-class tournaments for Central Province and a Sri Lankan under-23s team. He toured Bangladesh with Sri Lanka A in December 1992, and the following month toured South Africa with a Sri Lankan under-24s side.\\n \\nLeapfrogging Ashley de Silva and Romesh Kaluwitharana (the two wicket-keepers used in Sri Lanka\\'s previous series) for selection, Dassanayake made his international debut in August 1993, playing three Tests and two ODIs in a home series against South Africa. Prior to the first Test, he had impressed selectors by recording six dismissals in an innings in a warm-up game for a Sri Lanka Board XI. After his debut series, Dassanayake\\'s next international was a one-off Test against the West Indies in December 1993. The following month, he was selected for a tour of India, playing in three Tests and one ODI. At the 1994 Austral-Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, Dassanayake played ODIs against Australia and New Zealand for the first time. His next internationals came in a home series against Pakistan in August 1994. This was followed by the Singer World Series (a quadrangular ODI tournament hosted in Sri Lanka), and then by a tour of Zimbabwe.\\n \\nDassanayake played his final international matches in December 1994, at the Mandela Trophy (a one-off ODI tournament hosted in South Africa). He was unable to maintain his batting at the standard required for international competition, averaging just 13.06 across eleven Tests and 10.62 across sixteen ODIs. In his first domestic season after being dropped from the national team, Dassanayake scored two first-class centuries, including a career-high 144 for Bloomfield against the Panadura Sports Club. Although he never returned to the senior Sri Lankan team, he did play several more series for Sri Lanka A, appearing against the United Arab Emirates and India A in December 1995, against Bangladesh and Pakistan A in February 1997, and against England A in February 1998. His domestic career with Bloomfield ended after the 2000–01 season.\\n \\nCanada\\n \\nDassanayake immigrated to Canada in 2001, settling in Ontario. After meeting the residency qualifications, he made his international debut for Canada at the 2005 ICC Trophy, held in Ireland. He appeared in all seven of his team\\'s matches, recording eight dismissals (five catches and three stumpings) and scoring 76 runs, with a highest score of 36 not out against Scotland. Later in the year, Dassanayake represented Canada in ICC Intercontinental Cup matches against Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, serving as captain in the absence of John Davison. Against Bermuda, he played solely as a batsman, with Ashish Bagai taking the gloves. Dassanayake\\'s final appearance for Canada came in August 2006, in an Intercontinental Cup game against Kenya. He was 36 at the time, and again played solely as a batsman.\\n  \\nCoaching career\\n \\nCanada\\n \\nIn August 2007 he was named as permanent coach of Canada, having been in temporary charge since June, replacing Andy Pick.

As part of the selection process, he served as a guest coach at a training camp for the national squad, and also coached a combined ICC Americas invitational team at the West Indies Cricket Board\\'s under-19 tournament. In September 2016, it was announced that Dassanayake had won the position, with his first major tournament in charge to be the 2016 World Cricket League Division Four event in Los Angeles.

Considered as one of the greatest ODI players of all time, Jayasuriya is well known for his powerful striking and match winning all-round performances in One Day International cricket. Jayasuriya is credited for having revolutionized One Day International cricket with his explosive batting with Romesh Kaluwitharana in 1996, which initiated the hard-hitting modern day batting strategy of all nations.Jayasuriya was an all-rounder, who had an international cricket career that spread over two decades, Jayasuriya is the only player to score over 12,000 runs and capture more than 300 wickets in One Day International cricket, and hence regarded as one of the best all rounders in the history of limited-overs cricket. He was named the Most Valuable Player of 1996 Cricket World Cup and Wisden Cricketers\\' Almanack broke an age old tradition by naming him one of Five Cricketers’ of the Year 1997 despite not playing the previous season in England. Jayasuriya was also the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team from 1999 to 2003.He retired from Test cricket in December 2007 and from limited overs cricket in June 2011. On 28 January 2013, Sri Lanka Cricket appointed him as the chairman of cricket selection committee. Sri Lanka won the ICC World Twenty20 for the first time in 2014, during his tenure as the chief selector.Jayasuriya ran for public office at the 2010 Sri Lankan general elections and was elected to the parliament from his native Matara District. He topped the UPFA parliamentary election list for Matara district by obtaining 74,352 preferential votes. He served as the deputy minister of Postal services in the former UPFA government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, and later as the Deputy Minister of Local Government & Rural Development under president Maithripala Sirisena. Jayasuriya did not contest for the 2015 Sri Lankan general election, though he won most votes from Matara district under UPFA in the 2010 Sri Lankan general election.Early life and careerSanath Jayasuriya was born in the Southern Sri Lankan city of Matara, to the family of Dunstan and Breeda Jayasuriya. He has an elder brother, Chandana Jayasuriya. He was educated at St. Servatius\\' College, Matara, where his cricketing talents were nourished by his school principal, G.L. Galappathy, and cricket coach, Lionel Wagasinghe. He excelled in cricket while at St. Servatius College, Matara and captained the college cricket team at the annual St. Thomas\\'–St. Servatius Cricket Encounter in 1988. Jayasuriya was picked as the \\'Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year\\' in the Outstation Segment in 1988. He also received the awards for the \\'Best Batsman\\' and \\'Best All-rounder\\' in the Outstation Segment at the Observer School Cricket Awards ceremony in the same year. Jayasuriya represented Sri Lanka in the inaugural ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup which was held in Australia in 1988 and was subsequently selected for a tour in Pakistan a few months later with the Sri Lanka \\'B\\' team, where he made two unbeaten double centuries. Shortly afterwards he was drafted into the national side for the tour to Australia in 1989–90.He made his One Day International debut against Australia at Melbourne on Boxing Day of 1989 and his Test debut against New Zealand at Hamilton in February 1991.Style and international careerBatting styleAlong with his opening partner Romesh Kaluwitharana, Jayasuriya revolutionized One Day International batting with his aggressive tactics during the 1996 Cricket World Cup, a strategy they first tried on the preceding tour of Australia. The tactic used was to take advantage of the early fielding restrictions by smashing the opening bowlers to all parts of the cricket ground, particularly by lofting their deliveries over the mandatory infielders, rather than the established tactic of building up momentum gradually. This was a novel but potentially match-winning tactic at that time, and Sri Lanka, who had previously never made it out of the preliminary rounds, went on to win the World Cup without a single defeat. Their new gameplan is now the standard opening batting strategy in limited overs cricket for the modern era. Glenn McGrath cited Jayasuriya in his XI of toughest batsmen, noting \"it is always a massive compliment to someone to say they changed the game, and his storming innings in the 1996 World Cup changed everyone\\'s thinking about how to start innings.\"Jayasuriya is known for both cuts and pulls along with his trademark shot, a lofted cut over point. He was one of the key players in Sri Lanka\\'s victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, where he was adjudged Man of the Tournament in recognition of his all-round contributions. His philosophy towards batting is summarized by an all-aggression approach and over the years he has dominated almost every one day bowling combination that he has faced at one stage or another. This is because of his ability to make huge match-winning contributions at rapid pace once he gets in, he holds the record for the second highest number of one day centuries and has scored the second most 150+ scores (4 scores) (Sachin Tendulkar has the most 150+ scores at 5). His devastating performances have ensured that Sri Lanka have won almost 80% of the matches that he scored over 50 runs in limited overs cricket. When asked in an interview who are the most challenging bowlers he had faced in the game, he named in the order Wasim Akram, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose.Bowling styleJayasuriya is a spin bowler known for quickly getting through his overs.Test careerSanath Jayasuriya held the record for the highest Test score made by a Sri Lankan, 340 against India in 1997. This effort was part of a second-wicket partnership with Roshan Mahanama that set the then all-time record for any partnership in Test history, with 576 runs. Both records were surpassed in July 2006 when fellow Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene scored 374 as part of a 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara against South Africa. On 20 September 2005, during the Second Test of the home series against Bangladesh, Jayasuriya became the first Sri Lankan to play 100 Tests, and the 33rd Test cricketer to achieve this feat.Jayasuriya announced his intention to retire from Test cricket following the Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka in April 2006. He reversed his decision soon after, however, joining the Sri Lankan cricket team in England in May 2006. Missing the first two Tests, Jayasuriya returned in the Third Test at Trent Bridge.After scoring 78 runs on day three of the first Test against England in Kandy in 2007, he announced he was to retire from Test cricket at the end of the match. In that inning he hit six fours in one over against James Anderson.One day International Career2009–2010Jayasuriya held the records for the fastest fifty (against Pakistan 17 balls), fastest 100 for Sri Lanka(against Pakistan 48 balls) and fastest 150 (against England in 95 balls) in ODI cricket. His fastest 50 stayed 19 years, where his half-century is regarded as the best because he achieved this feat in an era where no any fielding restrictions and power plays are available. It took 19 years to surpass the fastest 50 with all limited over new restrictions and other fielding restrictions. However, he subsequently lost fastest fifty to AB de Villiers. Jayasuriya and Sachin Tendulkar are the only players in history to have 4 ODI scores over 150, where Jayasuriya is the only player of the history to have scored two consecutive 150+ scores.Jayasuriya\\'s highest ODI score is 189 runs, scored against India in Sharjah in 2000. It remains the highest ODI score by a Sri Lankan, and at the time of the innings it was the third-highest in ODI history. Currently the score is 11th highest ODI score of all time and highest by a Sri Lankan.Jayasuriya was the previous record-holder for the fastest century (off 48 balls), before losing that to Shahid Afridi\\'s 37 ball century. This is cited as the first ever fastest century scored in less than 50 balls in world cricket. The record was then broken by Corey Anderson of New Zealand (36 balls), which is currently holds by AB de Villiers of South Africa with 31 ball century. He has also held the world record for most ODI sixes (270 in 441 ODIs), which was surpassed by Shahid Afridi during the 2010 Asia Cup match against Bangladesh. He became the fourth batsman to score more than 10,000 runs and the second batsman to score more than 12,000, and 13,000 runs in the history of ODIs. He also has 28 centuries, the third highest in ODIs. He held the record of scoring most runs in an ODI over (30; he has achieved this twice), and first batsman to score over 30 in an over. This record is now held by South Africa\\'s Herschelle Gibbs (36 runs in an over).During the one-day Natwest series in May 2006 in England, he scored two centuries, including scoring 152 off 99 balls in the final match. In that innings, he and Upul Tharanga (109) put on 286 runs for the first wicket, a new record. Jayasuriya\\'s batting display earned him the Man of the Series award as Sri Lanka whitewashed England for the first time in their home soil by winning the series 5–0.Following the Natwest Trophy, Sri Lanka travelled to the Netherlands for a two-match one-day series. In the first game, Jayasuriya scored 157 off 104 balls as Sri Lanka posted 443/9, beating the 438/9 South Africa scored against Australia in March 2006. Sri Lanka won the match by 195 runs. On a personal note the innings was his 4th score of over 150 in ODI cricket and he is currently the only player to do so other than Sachin Tendulkar who has achieved it five times. It was also his second successive score of 150 plus, another first in ODI cricket.He also scored 2 centuries and 2 half-centuries in the 2007 Cricket World Cup held in the West Indies.In 2008, his one-day career was all but over when he was omitted for the ODIs in the West Indies. However, a stirring performance in the IPL—finishing the third-highest run-getter with 514 runs—prompted his country\\'s sports minister to intervene in his selection for the Asia Cup. He ultimately shaped Sri Lanka\\'s title victory with a blistering hundred under pressure. His international career has been revived at the age of 41, after being recalled to the One-day and Twenty-20 squads for Sri Lanka\\'s 2011 tour of England and Scotland.During 2008 Asia Cup, Jayasuriya scored a century against Bangladesh on his birthday. With this century, he became the third cricketer out of four overall, to score an ODI century on a birthday. The two others before Jayasuriya to score the century were two Indians Vinod Kambli and Sachin Tendulkar. The last one to score a century on his birthday is blackcap Ross Taylor.Twenty20 careerDuring the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Jayasuriya appeared to break his tradition of using Kookaburra bats by wielding a normal Reebok sponsored bat. He achieved two half centuries in the group stages against New Zealand and Kenya in this tournament. He also shares a dubious record with James Anderson for having the most expensive figures in a Twenty20 international, having been hit for 64 runs in the maximum of 4 overs. After the Twenty20 World Cup, Jayasuriya played in Sri Lanka\\'s 3–2 One Day International series defeat against England, achieving limited success and then in the 2–0 Test series defeat in Australia. In December 2007, Jayasuriya confirmed that he has signed for Warwickshire for the Twenty20 Cup.In April 2008, he joined the Mumbai Indians to play in the Indian Premier League T20. After scoring a devastating 114 not out off just 48 balls for the Mumbai Indians against Chennai, Jayasuriya regained his position in the one-day side after he had been dropped for the West Indies tour. He then followed up his century with a 17-ball 48 not out to surpass the Kolkata Knight Riders\\' score of 67 in just the 6th over, resulting in the biggest victory in Twenty20 history in terms of balls remaining. In 2010 has signed with Worcestershire for their Twenty20 campaign. At the age of 42, Jayasuriya played for the Ruhuna Rhinos in the qualifying round of the 2011 Champions League. In February 2012 Jayasuria played for the Khulna Royal Bengals in the inaugural Bangladesh Premier League, later that year he played for Kandurata Warriors in the inaugural Sri Lanka Premier League.Captaincy and all-round performancesJayasuriya was chosen as the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 1996 and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1997. He served as the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team in 38 test matches and 117 one day internationals from 1999 to 2003. Jayasuriya led Sri Lanka to the knock-out stage of the 2003 cricket world cup, but stepped down from the captaincy after the loss to Australia in the semi final. He was also a very useful all-rounder with a good batting average in both Test cricket and One Day Internationals, and had an excellent batting strike rate in One Day Internationals.As a left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he had a reasonable bowling average and an economy rate. He regularly helped to decrease the workloads of contemporary Sri Lankan strike bowlers Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas. At the end of his career Jayasuriya took more than 400 wickets in international cricket with over 300 wickets in One Day Internationals. Jayasuriya was also a skillful infielder, with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the seventh highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the eleventh highest success rate.Personal lifeEarly in the year 2000, Sanath married Sandra Tania Rosemary De Silva. They have three kids Savindi Jayasuriya, Yalindi Jayasuriya and Ranuka Jayasuriya. He is also the first cricketer to be appointed as a UN Goodwill Ambassador (by UNAIDS, Geneva) for his commitment to prevention of HIV/AIDS among young people in Sri Lanka. He entered politics in February 2010 as a candidate for Matara District. His party is the United People\\'s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) of president Mahinda Rajapaksa. Jayasuriya continued to play cricket after he has secured the most number of preferential votes from the Matara District by obtaining 74,352 votes.In October 2013, he was appointed as deputy minister of Postal services in the UPFA government.He resigned from Chief Selector post with his members on 3 April 2015. On 10 June 2015, Jayasuriya with three other UPFA Parliamentarians took oaths from President Maithripala Sirisena as new deputy ministers. Jayasuriya was appointed as Deputy Minister of Local Government and Rural Development. He was in office until the Parliament dissolved on 26 June 2015. in the 2015 election Jayasuriya did not run for office but join the campaign of the United National Party that won the election. He was later appointed the chairman of selectors of Sri Lanka cricket.Player statisticsCareer performanceTest performance against each opponentAs of 7 December 2007: Until his retirement.ODI performance against each opponentAs of 28 June 2011: Until his retirement.CenturiesJayasuriya has scored 14 Test and 28 ODI centuries.Although Jayasuriya made his Test debut in 1991, it was not until 1996 that he scored his first century, when he had become a regular player in the Sri Lankan side. His career high of 340 against India in August 1997 was the highest score by a Sri Lankan cricketer until 2006, and is also part of the highest team total (952/6) made in Test cricket. He has also scored two double centuries; 213 against England and 253 against Pakistan. His 157 against Zimbabwe in 2004 is the second fastest century by a Sri Lankan player. Jayasuriya, having scored centuries against every Test playing nation except New Zealand and West Indies, retired from Test cricket in 2007 with 14 to his name.Jayasuriya made his ODI debut in 1989, and started playing as an opening batsman in 1993. He went on to score his first century in 1994 against New Zealand. From then on, Jayasuriya has scored the highest number of ODI centuries for Sri Lanka with 28 to his name. He currently holds the third place for most centuries in a career, behind Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar (with 49 ODI centuries) and Ricky Ponting (30 centuries). His second century, 134 against Pakistan in 1996, was scored at a strike rate of 206.15 and was the fastest century in ODI cricket at the time. This record was later broken by Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi. The 189 he made against India in 2000 is the sixth highest ODI score in a single innings. Making his second highest ODI score of 157 against the Netherlands in 2006, Jayasuriya paved the way for Sri Lanka to set the world record for the highest ODI team total of 443/9. With his 107 against India on 28 January 2009, Jayasuriya—39 years and 212 days old at the time—became the oldest player to score a century, which was surpassed by UAE batsman Khurram Khan and also became the second player to score more than 13,000 runs in a career. Sanath Jayasuriya also holds the record of fourth fastest 150 in one day internationals. he made 152 vs England at Leeds on 1 July 2006, off just 99 balls which was the fastest at that time, and now after AB de Villiers 63 ball 150, Shane Watson 93 ball 150, and Luke Ronchi 95 ball 150.Five–wicket hauls\\nInternational recordsBold\\n ones are World Records.AwardsJayasuriya has influenced for many international awards in his 20 years of cricketing career. He is second only to Sachin Tendulkar by the number of Man of the match awards for ODIs, where Tendulkar has 62 Man of the Match awards, and Jayasuriya has 47 of them. He also has 11 ODI Man of the Series awards. Besides ODI awards, he has 4 Test Man of the Match awards and single Test Man of the Series awards. He has 5 T20I Man of the Match awards as well.Product and brand endorsementsSanath Jayasuriya endorses the following products:DancingOn May 2012, Jayasuriya signed a contract to participate as a contestant on 5th season of the Indian celebrity dance show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa'}, {'cricketerName': 'Muttiah Muralitharan', 'bio': 'Cricketer', 'Intro': 'Cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer ', 'From': ' New Zealand Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  17 April 1972, Kandy, Central Province, Sri Lanka ', 'Age': '49 years', 'Family': '    Spouse:  Madhimalar Ramamurthy     ', 'Stats': '    Height:  170     ', 'Profiles': '      ', 'paragraph': 'Deshabandu \\nMuttiah Muralitharan\\n (Tamil: \\nமுத்தையா முரளீதரன்\\n, Sinhalese: \\nමුත්තයියා මුරලිදරන්\\n; also spelt \\nMuralidaran\\n; born \\n17 April\\n 1972) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who was rated the greatest Test match bowler ever by \\nWisden Cricketers\\' Almanack\\n in 2002. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, registering his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from his final ball in his last Test match. Muralitharan holds the world record for the most wickets in both test and one-day cricket. In 2017, he became the only Sri Lankan to included to the ICC Hall of Fame.Muralitharan took the wicket of Gautam Gambhir on 5 February 2009 in Colombo to surpass Wasim Akram\\'s ODI record of 502 wickets. He became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket when he overtook the previous record-holder Shane Warne on \\n3 December\\n 2007. Muralitharan had previously held the record when he surpassed Courtney Walsh\\'s 519 wickets in 2004, but he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was overtaken by Warne.Averaging over six wickets per Test, Muralitharan is one of the most successful bowlers in the game. Muralitharan held the number one spot in the International Cricket Council’s player rankings for Test bowlers for a record period of 1,711 days spanning 214 Test matches.Muralitharan\\'s career was beset by controversy over his bowling action for much of his international career. Due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery, his bowling action was called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket community. After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan\\'s action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999. Former Australian Test player Bruce Yardley, who himself was an off spinner in his day, was assigned with the task of ensuring Muralitharan bowled all his deliveries with the same vigour as he would do so in match conditions when tested in 2004. Muralitharan had not commenced bowling the doosra at this time. The legality of his doosra was first called into question in 2004. This delivery was found to exceed the ICC elbow extension limit by nine degrees, five degrees being the limit for spinners at that time. Based on official studies into bowling actions, which revealed that 99% of bowlers whose actions were examined exceeded the elbow flexion limits, ICC revised the limits applying to all bowlers in 2005. The new limit of 15-degrees, one degree greater than Muralitharan was bowling his doosra, allowed him to continue without being called for throwing from then on.In February 2009, after becoming cricket\\'s highest wicket-taker in both forms of the game Muttiah Muralitharan hinted that he might retire at the conclusion of the 2011 World Cup. He stated \"I think I am fit in my body and mind, I am enjoying my cricket and want to play more. But after the next World Cup, I will have nothing left to achieve in the game. The World Cup should mark the end of my career.\" Muralitharan announced his retirement from Test cricket after the first Test against India at Galle which commenced on \\n18 July\\n 2010. During that match he captured 8 wickets and became the first to reach the milestone of taking 800 Test wickets by dismissing Pragyan Ojha.He was the sixth international franchise player signed to the Caribbean Premier League and the first Sri Lankan player to be named to the new Twenty20 tournament.'}, {'cricketerName': 'Chaminda Mendis', 'bio': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Intro': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer ', 'From': ' Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  28 December 1968 ', 'Age': '52 years', 'paragraph': 'Manimeldura Chaminda Mendis (born 28 December 1968) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who was born in Galle, Sri Lanka.

Considered as one of the best left arm bowlers in the history of the game, Herath is a specialist left-arm bowler for Sri Lanka and holds the record of best bowling figures in Test matches by a left-arm spinner.\\nOn 29 May 2016, Herath became the third Sri Lankan bowler to take 300 wickets in Test cricket history after Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas. On 8 November 2016, Herath became only the third bowler in history to take five-wicket hauls against all Test-playing nations. He is the oldest player to reach 350 Test wickets.\\nOn 23 October 2016, Herath was announced as captain for Sri Lanka tour to Zimbabwe. Angelo Mathews, the regular captain, was injured. With this he became the oldest Sri Lankan player to lead a Test team for the first time and from any country since Tom Graveney in 1968Early life and career\\n \\nBorn on 19 March 1978, in the small village of Waduwawa, Kurunegala, on the southeastern tip of the Northwestern Province as the second of the family. His elder brother is Deepthi Herath. He was also promoted to the opening batting in school times, and acted as a pacer, until his coach told him to start spin bowling due to height problem. Before starting professional career, Hearth was working at Sampath Bank as a clerk, when he met brother of Chandika Hathurusingha.\\n \\nHerath started his cricket career at his first school Mayurapada Central College, Narammala. Later he moved to Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala. Having made his first class debut for Kurunegala Youth Cricket Club in 1996–97 cricket season, Rangana Herath currently represents Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club in Sri Lankan first class cricket. He represented Moors Sports Club from 1998/99 to 2009/10 in local first class cricket and also played for Surrey during the latter part of the 2009 English cricket season. In April 2010, Herath joined Hampshire, where he played in the first half of the 2010 County Championship.\\n Personal life\\n \\nHerath is married to his longtime partner Senani Herath, and they have two sons.\\n International debut\\n \\nHerath made his Test debut at Galle International Stadium, Sri Lanka against Australia in 1999. His One Day International debut came five years later in 2004, against Zimbabwe at Harare Sports Club. During the 2016 England series, Herath was ranked as 13th Test match bowler in the world, having hit the heights of second in the list in 2012.\\n \\nAlthough Herath made his Test debut back in 1999, he never came to the prominence as a leading spinner until the retirement of Muralitharan. Herath made a successful comeback to Test cricket in 2009 against Pakistan and took over the mantle of Sri Lanka\\'s main spin bowler from Muralitharan. Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene rated Herath as Sri Lanka\\'s number one bowler after the retirement of Muralitharan.\\n  \\nTest cricket\\n \\nAustralia (1999)\\n \\nRangana Herath ascended to prominence against Australia in 1999 with a \"mystery\" ball. He broke into the national side after an impressive A tour to England. Herath while playing in two test matches in the series, deceived the visiting Australians with a delivery that darted the other way. He took six test wickets against the Australians.\\n \\nPakistan, New Zealand (2009)\\n \\nRangana Herath made a comeback to the Test side, taking 15 wickets in the 3 match Test series vs. Pakistan played in Sri Lanka, also winning the man-of-the-match award in the first Test. \\n \\nHerath then took 8 wickets in the second Test in the two match Test-series between Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka. This led Sri Lanka to a win, and a series victory.\\n \\nIndia, West Indies (2010)\\n \\nHerath played only in the test at Galle during the home series against India. Though Sri Lanka won, he only managed to take the wicket of Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh in that match. Herath was recalled for the second test match against the West Indies in November 2010. In that match played at the newly renovated R. Premadasa Stadium, he took three wickets in the first innings.\\n \\nSri Lanka Tour in South Africa (2011)\\n \\nIn the second Test of Sri Lanka\\'s tour of South Africa in December 2011, Herath took nine wickets and won the \\nMan of the Match\\n award. Sri Lanka won the match by 208 runs; it was their first Test win in South Africa.\\n \\nEngland Tour in Sri Lanka (2012)\\n \\nHerath took 12 Wickets during the first test match of the 2012 England Vs. Sri Lanka Test Series. His match winning performance helped him to secure the \"Man of the Match\" award in Galle. Rangana Herath was England\\'s latest spin tormentor with 6 for 74 during the first inning and he took another 6 wickets for just 97 runs and confirmed the Sri Lanka\\'s victory against the touring English team.\\n \\nPakistan Tour in Sri Lanka (2014)\\n \\nIn the first innings of the second Test, Herath took nine wickets for 127 runs, the best figures for a left-arm bowler in Test cricket. He was man of the match in both Test matches and also man of the series.\\n \\nIndia Tour in Sri Lanka (2015)\\n \\nIn the second innings of the first Test, Herath took seven wickets for 48 runs, where Sri Lanka only had 175 runs behind India\\'s total of 375. Herath was only able to take a single wicket in the first innings and had a fairly poor performance in the first innings. But his strong comeback in the second innings with other new spinner Tharindu Kaushal, India were all out for 112 runs, where Herath took 7 for 48 and Kaushal with 3 for 47. This was his 22nd five-wicket haul in Tests.\\n \\nWest Indies Tour in Sri Lanka (2015)\\n \\nIn the first match at Galle, Sri Lanka posted a huge total of 484 with the help of two centuries. In the bowling, Herath took his 23rd five-wicket haul in test cricket and the very first against West Indies. He finished with 6/68 runs and West Indies were all out for 251. This gave windies to keep follow-on and they came in to bat for the second innings just on the third day. Just as in the first innings, Herath was all over the Windies, where they all out for 227 runs, giving Sri Lanka a huge win by an innings and 6 runs. Herath took 4/79 in second innings, finished his fifth ten-wicket haul in Test cricket and adjudged man of the match award as well. The second match was a show of bowlers. Both teams do not score more than 250 in each innings, and Herath only took a single wicket in the first innings. West Indies required 245 runs to win the match, but Herath strikes again, picked up 4 wickets and sealed the game for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka won the series 2-0 and Herath was the Player of the Series\\n \\nSri Lanka Tour in England (2016)\\n \\nHerath took two wickets in the first test at Leeds, with 299 test wickets. However, Sri Lanka lost the match by an innings and 88 runs. In the second match at Chester-Le-Street, Herath took his 300th test wicket by dismissing Steven Finn, caught by himself. He became the third Sri Lankan after Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vass to reach 300 test wickets in history. He also played well with the bat scoring 61 whilst batting with Dinesh Chandimal before being out to James Anderson.\\n \\nAustralia Tour in Sri Lanka (2016)\\n \\nHerath showed his talents in home soil back against Australia in the test series. In the first test, he took 4 four wickets in first innings and match-winning five-wicket haul in the second innings. Sri Lanka eventually won the match by 106 runs, which is only the second win against Australia in 27 test matches by Sri Lanka. Herath has took 7 fifers in the fourth innings of Tests by 29 innings, which is the most fifers in second innings in least innings, previously held by legendary Muttiah Muralitharan, who took 35 innings to reach the milestone. Bowling figures of 5 for 58 in the match is also the best bowling figures in a Test innings in Pallekele.\\n \\nDuring the second Test at Galle, Herath took a hat-trick by dismissing Adam Voges, Peter Nevill, and Mitchell Starc in the Australian first innings. He became the second Sri Lankan after Nuwan Zoysa, and first Sri Lankan spinner to take a Test hat-trick. He is also the second left-arm orthodox bowler ever to take a Test hatrick after Johnny Briggs in 1892. In the process he became the oldest cricketer to take a hat-trick in Test matches.\\n \\nIn the third Test at SSC, Herath took his 25th and 26th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. This is his fourth consecutive Test against Australia in where he has taken four or more wickets in the opponent\\'s first innings. His 25th fifer mark is the highest by a bowler to take fifers since 2009. In this period, no other bowler has taken even 20 such hauls. His ten wicket haul in the match gave the series whitewash against Number 1 ranked Australia for the first time in history. He took 13 wickets in the last test match and 28 wickets in the \\nseries\\n. Both these wicket figures are record for a Sri Lankan against Australia.\\n \\nSri Lanka Tour in Zimbabwe (2016)\\n \\nAfter usual captain Angelo Mathews injured during ODI series against Australia, vice captain Dinesh Chandimal was also injured during T20I series of the same tour. With these major players absent, Herath was appointed as the captain of Test team for the Zimbabwe tour. On 29 September 2016, he led the team in a test match, becoming the oldest player to lead a Test team for the first time since Somachandra de Silva in 1983. The match was won by Sri Lanka, where Herath led from the front, took 6 wickets in the match.\\n \\nOn 8 November 2016, Herath took his 27th five wicket haul, becoming the third overall to take five-wicket hauls against all Test-playing nations, after Muttiah Muralitharan and Dale Steyn. He took 13 wickets in the second test match, recording best bowling figures against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. He dismissed Carl Mumba by taking 350th wicket, recorded as the oldest player to achieve the feat. Only Muralitharan has taken more 12-wicket hauls than Herath, who has five to Murali\\'s six. Sri Lanka whitewashed Zimbabwe 2-0 and Herath adjudged man of the match for his impressive performance.\\n \\nSri Lanka Tour in South Africa (2016/17)\\n \\nDuring the second Test at Newlands, Herath surpassed 355 test wickets of Chaminda Vaas by dismissing Kyle Abbott for LBW, becoming the second highest wicket taker for Sri Lanka.\\n Limited over career\\n \\n2014 World T20I\\n \\nHerath\\'s best T20I bowling spells came during the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. His first World Twenty20 match was against New Zealand on 31 March 2014. By batting first, Sri Lanka scored only 119 all out, Mahela scored 25 runs as the best batsman. Blackcaps came to the crease as the favorites to win the match, because 120 is not a huge task at all to them as smashers - Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, and Corey Anderson. During the match, Anderson was injured and so New Zealand played with only 10 players in batting. New Zealand started pretty well with Guptill and Kane Williamson. At this time, Malinga decided to go with Herath, who turned the match in nowhere. Herath ball Guptill and he lunges forward to push to mid-on. Sets off for a single straight away but his partner is not at all interested. The bowler is wise to the mistake, rushes across to his right and cuts the ball in its path and sends in a rocket throw and Sangakkara whips the bails off. After this run-out, it wall all Herath. he stumped skipper McCullum, then caught Ross Taylor to lbw. Next, Herath bowled James Neesham in first ball he faced. He then captured Luke Ronchi for lbw, and New Zealand were never in the game. Finally New Zealand all out for just 60 runs, which is the lowest score by a test playing nation in Twenty20 Internationals. Herath finished with 5 wickets for 3 runs, earned him Man-of-the-match. With this win, Sri Lanka moved their fourth consecutive World T20 semi-finals and eventually won the World T20I title as well.\\n Limited overs retirement\\n \\nHerath revealed his intentions to retire from ODIs and T20Is after 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Sri Lanka quit from the World T20 from the first round and Herath announced his retirement on 17 April 2016. This was largely due to the fact that, Herath was picked to the recent limited over tournaments game after a game and with the few years to come with his age, he wants to focus more towards Test cricket. Until retirement, Herath played 71 ODIs, took 74 wickets with the average of 31.91. He played 17 T20Is, where took 18 wickets with the best bowling figures of 5 for 3 against New Zealand in 2014 World T20I.\\n  \\nRecords and achievements\\n \\n \\nHighest wicket-taker in Tests in

He represented his country at under-15 and under-19 level and took 23 wickets in four matches at an Under-23 tournament of 2003-04.

Sehwag hit the ball for six but as the winning run was registered as soon as the umpire signalled no ball, Sehwag's shot was deemed to have been made after the end of the match.

He is a left-handed opening batsman and occasional wicket-keeper.Early lifeUpul Tharanga had his education at Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda. He started his cricket career as a teenager at his school. Having played for Nondescripts since the age of 15, he played for Sri Lanka\\'s under-15, under-17 and under-19 squads. He had a successful under-19 World Cup in 2004 with successful innings of 117 and 61 in successive games. He was sent by the Sri Lankan cricketing board to play league cricket for Loughton Cricket Club in Essex.Tharanga\\'s Sri Lankan call-up in July 2005 made for a mixed 2005, after his family home was washed away by the Asian tsunami. His equipment, which was also washed away, was replaced by Kumar Sangakkara. Tharanga graduated to the \"A\" team and in July he was selected for the full squad.International careerOn the 2006 tour of England he really began to develop, particularly in the one-day game, scoring over 300 runs in Sri Lanka\\'s 5–0 whitewash of the hosts. In addition, Tharanga is also well known for taking part in a record-breaking first wicket partnership with Sanath Jayasuriya in the final match of this series. He finished off with 109 off 102 balls, and played a pivotal role in completing the whitewash against England.Tharanga lost his form in the 2007 World Cup scoring only one half century (against New Zealand) he then continued his poor run of form in the home series against England in 2007 where he failed to contribute and often fell before the 10th over often resulting in a middle-order collapse. Subsequently he lost his ODI place to Malinda Warnapura and his test place to Michael Vandort but he remains within the squad.However, in the 2011 World Cup, he is back to performing remarkably. In the quarter-final game against England, his partnership with Tillakaratne Dilshan, wrapped up the game, each acquiring centuries. His strong form has returned him to the opening position in the strong Sri-Lankan batting line up.He has also come in for special praise from Jayasuriya, one of the legends of cricket, saying that he could be the next captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team.Through ranksUpul Tharanga is the \\nsecond batsman in the world who was involved with 7 times 200+ partnerships in ODI cricket\\n. The only other player to achieve this feat is Ricky Ponting.On 2 July 2013, Upul Tharanga scored the second highest ODI score of 174* by a Sri Lankan only behind Sanath Jayasuriya who scored 189 against India. With that innings he became the 9th Sri Lankan player to pass 5000 runs margin. Despite of his low match participation, he has earned 13 centuries and 11 man of the match titles for his name throughout his international career.Test careerAfter 8 years of scarcity for Test cricket, Tharanga was called to the third Test match against Pakistan on 3 July 2015. He was used as the replacement for Kumar Sangakkara who did play for first two Tests, but not to third Test at Kandy, due to his retirement consideration during India tour. He scored 46 runs in the first innings and 48 in the second innings. However, Sri Lanka lost the series by 2-1.Tharanga holds the record of waiting for maximum number of days between two test centuries. Since World War-2 it is the longest gaps between Test centuries by a player.Limited over comebackTharanga, who had a long ODI scarcity, was included to the ODI squad against Pakistan. Due to the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara, the number three position had a vacant and Sri Lanka cricket selected Tharanga for the crucial number three position in ODIs.CaptaincyDue to multiple injuries of usual captain Angelo Mathews, Tharanga was selected as Sri Lankan captain, to lead them in ODI tri series in Zimbabwe on 5 November 2016. On 14 November 2016, he led Sri Lankan team for the first time in an ODI against Zimbabwe, which was won comfortably by 8 wickets. At the end, Sri Lanka won the tri-series by defeating the hosts Zimbabwe in the final by 6 wickets.Tharanga was picked up back as the ODI captain for South Africa series, when Mathews was not available after the injury occurred during second T20I.Doping violationA urine sample provided by Tharanga after the world cup semi-final against New Zealand on 29 March 2011 was found to have metabolites of two glucocorticosteroids – prednisone and prednisolone, which are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Tharanga initially claimed he had taken some medication for asthma and had no idea it was a banned drug.An independent anti-doping tribunal was convened at which Tharanga pleaded guilty, claiming he had taken some herbal remedy to ease discomfort caused by a long-standing shoulder injury. The tribunal accepted that Tharanga \"had no intention to enhance his sporting performance or to mask the use of another performance enhancing substance, but that he had failed to satisfy the high levels of personal responsibility implicit upon him as an international cricketer subject to anti-doping rules\". The tribunal found Tharanga guilty of breaching the \\nICC Anti-Doping Code\\n and banned him from all cricket and cricket-related activities for a three-month period (9 May 2011 to 8 August 2011).International centuriesTest centuriesOne Day International centuriesInternational awardsOne-Day International Cricket'}, {'cricketerName': 'Nuwan Kavinda', 'bio': 'Cricketer', 'Intro':

His early cricket was played in Bahrain, the country of his birth, and he played at senior level for the Bahraini national side between 2004 and 2006, having earlier represented Bahrain at various underage levels.\\nBorn in Adliya, Manama, de Silva represented Bahrain at the 2000 Under-17 Asia Cup in Pakistan, despite being only 12 years old at the time. At his next major tournament, the 2004 ACC Under-17 Trophy, he captained Bahrain, and finished with 165 runs from five matches, the most of any Bahraini. His highest score was 72 from 68 balls against Thailand. Following his under-17s performance, de Silva was selected in the Bahraini senior squad for the 2004 ACC Trophy in Malaysia, still aged only 16. Although he did not take a wicket at the tournament, his two appearances, against Hong Kong and Oman, saw him become the youngest man to play senior cricket for Bahrain. In his only tournament for the Bahrain under-19s, the 2005 ACC Under-19 Cup in Nepal, de Silva set an ACC Under-19 Cup record, scoring 200 not out from 140 balls against Brunei.

A right-handed leg spinning all-rounder, he played in high-level Sri Lankan domestic competitions for Chilaw Marians Cricket Club and Panadura Sports Club early in his career. After emigrating to Italy, he made his debut for the Italian national side in April 2013, at the 2013 World Cricket League Division Three tournament.\\nCareer in Sri LankaBorn in Colombo, Marage's first recorded matches at a high level came during the 2001–02 season, when he played several games for Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club in an under-23 tournament. He made his first-class debut in November 2001, aged 20, playing for Chilaw Marians in the Premier Trophy. Marage finished his 2001–02 season with 107 runs and five wickets from seven Premier Trophy matches, as well as 61 runs and two wickets from six appearances in the Premier Limited Overs Tournament. His highest score, 42, came in the last fixture of the season, a Premier Trophy game against Moratuwa Sports Club.\\nMarage again appeared regularly for Chilaw Marians during the 2002–03 season, with nine out of a possible eleven Premier Trophy games. Against Ragama Cricket Club, he made what was to be his highest first-class score, 47 from eighth in the batting order. After his last match for Chilaw Marians in February 2003, Marage did not appear again at a high level until June 2004, when he played in an under-23 tournament for Saracens Sports Club. His 2004–05 senior season, his last in Sri Lanka, was spent with Panadura Sports Club, and consisted of six games in both the Premier Trophy and its limited-overs equivalent, as well as a single game in the knockout Twenty20 Tournament (the inaugural season of that format in Sri Lanka).\\nCareer in ItalyMarage made his debut for the Italian national team at the 2013 WCL Division Three tournament in Bermuda. On debut against Oman, he opened the batting with \\nDamian Fernando\\n, a former Chilaw Marians teammate. Marage made 19 runs from 25 balls (including two sixes) in that match, and took 1/18 from five overs while bowling. His other matches at the tournament were less successful – he made a three-ball duck against the United States and a golden duck against Bermuda, and failed to take a wicket in either match. The next major tournament for Marage and Italy was the 2013 European T20 Championship in England. He played in all seven matches, and his 276 runs was the most for Italy (and behind only Denmark's \\nFrederik Klokker\\n and Guernsey's Jeremy Frith overall). He topscored in three matches, with innings of 65* against Gibraltar, 107 against Norway, and 42 against Jersey. His innings against Norway, made in only 62 balls, was the first century in the tournament's history.\\nBy winning the European T20 Championship, Italy qualified for the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier, where matches had full Twenty20 status. Marage played in only five of Italy's games at the tournament – four out of seven group games (one being abandoned) and the quarter-final against Scotland. He had little success, making only five runs from three batting innings and conceding 44 runs (without taking a wicket) from five overs bowling. In an earlier warm-up game against the Netherlands he had been bowled by \\nTim Gruijters\\n from the first ball of the match. Marage finished third in both runs scored and wickets taken for Italy at the 2014 WCL Division Four tournament in Singapore. His two best performances there both came against Denmark – a man of the match 82 in a group-stage match (including a 150-run opening partnership with \\nAndrew Northcote\\n), and then 4/33 in the third-place playoff. Marage has since been named in Italy's squad for its next major tournament, the 2015 European T20 Championship in Jersey.\\n\"}, {'cricketerName': 'Rohitha Kottahachchi', 'bio': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Intro': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer ', 'From': ' Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  9 August 1971, Kalutara, Western Province, Sri Lanka ', 'Age': '50 years', 'Star sign': 'Leo', 'paragraph': \"\\nRohitha Kottahachchi\\n (born 9 August 1971) is a Sri Lankan former first class cricketer.

He made his debut in the 2nd ODI, where he came to bat on number 4 and scored an unbeaten 14 from 16 balls before Sri Lanka won by 8 wickets.\\n \\nPerera hit his maiden ODI ton against Bangladesh on 22 February 2014. He scored 106 from 124 balls before getting bowled By Rubel Hossain. He won the \"Man of the Match\" award.\\n \\nPerera was not qualified for the squad for 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup tournament due to poor performance against India and England. After the tournament starts, Dimuth Karunaratne was injured and Perera was called to the World Cup squad. He played his first World Cup match against Scotland on 11 March 2015, where he scored quick 24 runs. He was replaced to this match due to injury for Dinesh Chandimal against Australia. He opened the batting for Sri Lanka on quarter finals of the World Cup, where he failed again to score runs, only scored 3 runs. Sri Lanka eventually lost the match and quit from the World Cup as well.\\n \\nAfter the retirement of two cricket legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena from ODIs, Kusal was brought to the squad as the permanent opening batsman with Tillakaratne Dilshan during ODI series against Pakistan. He just lost the first match for quick 26 runs in Dambulla. In the second match at Pallekele, Kusal smashed Pakistani pace bowlers to all the parts of the ground and scored the joint second fastest ODI fifty by 17 balls with his legendary master Sanath Jayasuriya 17-ball fifty in 1997. The shots of Kusal was described by the international commentators as the dawn of a new Little Sana, with just the same aggressive batting by Sanath in the past. The strike rate of Kusal\\'s innings was 272 and it is now the \\nhighest strike rate in an innings of 50 or more runs by a Sri Lanka batsman in ODIs\\n, which he also surpassed his master Jayasuriya\\'s strike rate of 271.42 in 1996 against same opposition.\\n \\nSri Lanka scored 92 in 9 overs in the match until Kusal departs to 25-ball 68 runs, where Sri Lanka chased down 287 runs and won the match by 2 wickets at the end. This win gave the highest ever ODI run chase in Pallekele and second highest run chase in Sri Lankan soil.\\n \\nDuring the 2nd ODI match against West Indies, Kusal got out to 99 runs, just one short to his third century. He is the fourth Sri Lankan player to get out in 99 in ODIs, the other three are Kaluwitharana single time, Jayasuriya in two times, and Dilshan single time. He is the 29th of all cricketers to dismissed in 99.\\n \\nT20 International Career\\n \\nPerera made his T20I debut in the first T20I against Australia in January 2013 and scored 33 from 22 balls before getting caught behind off Australian all rounder, Glenn Maxwell. In this match he hit some aggressive shots and many compared him with Sanath Jayasuriya.\\n \\nOn 13 December 2013 he scored 84 runs from 59 balls against Pakistan and Sri Lanka and went on to score a massive total of 211. Sri Lanka won the match by 24 runs and Perera earned the \"Man of the Match\" for the performance. Kusal is the current wicket-keeper in T20 internationals.\\n \\n2014 World T20\\n \\nOn 22 March 2014 against South Africa, Perera scored 61 runs from just 40 balls. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 runs and Perera won the \"Man of The Match\" award. He scored 125 runs in the tournament at an average of 20.83 and an impressive strike rate of 145.48. He had some quick runs in the next matches, but failed to effect larger to the team. However, Sri Lanka won their first T20I title by defeating India in the final.\\n \\nTest career\\n \\nAfter the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara, his position remained vacant for a new player and Kusal was brought into the team. He made his Test debut for Sri Lanka against India on 28 August 2015. His arrival to the test team was not good at all, when he dropped Indian skipper Virat Kohli in fairly easy catch. But then he took 2 catches and 1 stumping in that innings. He showed his batting talents right on the first innings of the match, where he was the top scorer for Sri Lanka with 56 runs in first innings. In second innings as well, he scored 70 runs to be the 2nd Sri Lankan batsman to score 2 successive half centuries on Test debut after Dinesh Chandimal. But eventually Sri Lanka lost the match and also the series against India.\\n \\nAfter cleared from doping suspects, Kusal replaced injured seamer Dhammika Prasad in Sri Lanka Test squad for the rest of the England tour. He played for the third test at Lord\\'s and scored 42 runs in the first innings. Sri Lanka finally was able to drawn the match.\\n \\nPerera scored his maiden Test century on 29 October 2016, against Zimbabwe in the first Test against the, at Harare. The score consisted wide range of thrashing shot, which was compared to Jayasuriya by Zimbabweans who witnessed this for the first time in their soil. Perera devastated the Zimbabwean bowling attack for 15 fours and two sixes, including taking debutant Carl Mumba for five fours in an over after the tea break.\\n Doping charge\\n \\nPerera initially tested positive for a banned substance and was recalled from the New Zealand tour in December 2015. His urine sample was provided for a random test by the International Cricket Council during the home series against Pakistan in May 2015. He said that he took some medicine for a leech bite. After the A sample became positive, Kusal himself with the help of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board asked for the testing of the B sample, which was tested at Qatar. On 25 December 2015, the results of the B sample came back and it revealed that Kusal was positive for the banned substance. Meanwhile, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara informed that there is a conspiracy behind this scandal is to withdraw Kusal from 2016 ICC World Twenty20 tournament due to his effectiveness in the format. If the B sample was positive, he was likely to face a four-year ban.\\n \\nOn 11 May 2016, he was cleared of the charges. The integrity of the laboratory that tested the sample was brought into question, with the ICC hiring an independent expert to find that the lab\\'s outcome was not sustainable. Perera had spent some of his own money on fighting the charges, including travelling to the UK to undergo further tests to clear his name. After being cleared, Perera said that \"I don\\'t think there has been much damage done to my reputation\", after the media, fans and Sri Lankan Cricket Board stood by him. On July 6, ICC has agreed to support Sri Lanka Cricket and Kusal Perera\\'s claim for costs and damages from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).\\n International centuries\\n \\nTest centuries\\n \\n \\n \\nTest Centuries of Kusal Perera\\n \\n \\n \\nNo.\\n \\nScore\\n \\nMatch\\n \\nAgainst\\n \\nVenue\\n \\nCity, Country\\n \\nSeason\\n \\nResult\\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\n110\\n \\n8\\n \\n\\xa0\\nZimbabwe\\n \\nHarare Sports Club\\n \\nHarare, Zimbabwe\\n \\n2016\\n \\nWon\\n \\n \\n \\nOne-Day International centuries\\n \\n \\n \\nODI Centuries of Kusal Perera\\n \\n \\n \\nNo.\\n \\nScore\\n \\nMatch\\n \\nAgainst\\n \\nVenue\\n \\nCity, Country\\n \\nDate\\n \\nResult\\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\n106\\n \\n22\\n \\n\\xa0\\nBangladesh\\n \\nShere Bangla National Stadium\\n \\nMirpur, Bangladesh\\n \\nFeb 22, 2014\\n \\nWon\\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\n116\\n \\n48\\n \\n\\xa0\\nPakistan\\n \\nMRIC Stadium\\n \\nHambantota, Sri Lanka\\n \\nJuly 26, 2015\\n \\nWon\\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n135\\n \\n53\\n \\n\\xa0\\nIreland\\n \\nMalahide Cricket Club Ground\\n \\nMalahide, Ireland\\n \\nJune 18, 2016\\n \\nWon\\n \\n \\n  \\nAwards\\n \\nOne Day Internationals\\n \\nMan of the Match awards\\n \\n \\n \\nS No\\n \\nOpponent\\n \\nVenue\\n \\nDate\\n \\nMatch Performance\\n \\nResult\\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nBangladesh\\n \\nShere Bangla National Stadium, Dhaka\\n \\n22 February 2014\\n \\n106 (124 balls: 6x4, 5x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 6 wickets.\\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nPakistan\\n \\nPallekele Cricket Stadium, Kandy\\n \\n15 July 2015\\n \\n68 (25 balls: 13x4, 2x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 2 wickets.\\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nPakistan\\n \\nMRIC Stadium, Hambantota\\n \\n26 July 2015\\n \\n116 (109 balls: 9x4, 4x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 165 runs.\\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nWest Indies\\n \\nR Premadasa Stadium, Colombo\\n \\n4 November 2015\\n \\nWK 1 ct.\\xa0; 99 (92 balls: 7x4, 3x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 8 wickets (D/L).\\n \\n \\n \\nPlayer of the series awards\\n \\n \\n \\n#\\n \\nSeries\\n \\nSeason\\n \\nMatch Performance\\n \\nResult\\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nWest Indies in Sri Lanka\\n \\n2015/16\\n \\n163 Runs (3 Matches, 2×50) with avg. 54.33\\xa0; WK 4 ct.\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka Won the series 3-0.\\n \\n \\n \\nTwenty20 International cricket\\n \\nMan of the match awards\\n \\n \\n \\n#\\n \\nSeries\\n \\nSeason\\n \\nOpponent\\n \\nMatch Performance\\n \\nResult\\n \\n \\n \\n1\\n \\nBangladesh in Sri Lanka\\n \\n2013\\n \\nBangladesh\\n \\n64 runs (44 balls: 5x4, 4x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 17 runs.\\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nNew Zealand in Sri Lanka\\n \\n2013\\n \\nNew Zealand\\n \\n57 runs (37 balls: 6x4, 2x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 8 wickets.\\n \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\nSri Lanka in UAE\\n \\n2013\\n \\nPakistan\\n \\n84 runs (59 balls: 5x4, 4x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 24 runs.\\n \\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nSri Lanka in Bangladesh\\n \\n2014\\n \\nBangladesh\\n \\n64 runs (44 balls: 7x4, 1x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 2 runs.\\n \\n \\n \\n5\\n \\n2014 ICC World Twenty20\\n \\n2014\\n \\nSouth Africa\\n \\n61 runs (40 balls: 6x4, 3x6)\\n \\n\\xa0\\nSri Lanka won by 5 runs.\\n \\n \\n '}, {'cricketerName': 'Sudath Pasqual', 'bio': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Intro': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer ', 'From': ' Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  15 October 1961 ', 'Age': '60 years', 'paragraph': 'Sudath Prajiv Pasqual (born October 15, 1961, Colombo) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played two ODIs during the 1979 World Cup competition (the subsequent British Isles tour incorporated his only first-class appearances).

Wijesuriya took 15 first class wickets from five games on tour at a bowling average of 31.13.\\nInternational careerIn March the following year, Wijesuriya made his official international debut on the tour of Pakistan, bowling eight overs for 48 runs in a rain-shortened ODI and dismissing \\nMansoor Akhtar\\n for 20. Following that, he was called up for the third Test against Pakistan, but he bowled 24 wicketless overs, as he was taken apart by \\nZaheer Abbas\\n. Sri Lanka lost the Test by an innings and 102 runs, and Wijesuriya was quietly dropped and forgotten for three years.\\nThen, in 1985, he was recalled as Sri Lanka took on India. Wijesuriya took key wickets in the first ODI, removing \\nKrish Srikkanth\\n and \\nMohammad Azharuddin\\n early, but his eight overs cost 56 runs and India eked out a two-wicket victory. He was retained, however, bowling nine overs for 54 runs in the other two matches.\\n1985–86 Pakistan tourDespite the variable performances, he was kept in the side that toured Pakistan in 1985–86. However, he went wicketless in the first two Tests, despite bowling a total of 48 overs, before finally getting his first Test wicket at Karachi. Fellow spinner \\nAbdul Qadir\\n was his victim, caught by \\nSidath Wettimuny\\n, which finally gave him a Test bowling average. By the end of the match, however, that average had been set to 297 – where it remained, giving him the highest bowling average (for a time, West Indian \\nRawl Lewis\\n overtook Wijesuriya with one wicket for more than 300 runs but more success in 2008 brought down Lewis' bowling average). He also recorded his best ODI bowling figures on that tour, taking two for 25 from five overs, and also battling out to score 12 runs after the top order had been taken apart by \\nMudassar Nazar\\n, \\nMohsin Kamal\\n and \\nAbdul Qadir\\n. Despite the credible performance from Wijesuriya, Sri Lanka lost the match by 89 runs, and they suffered a 4–0 defeat in the ODI series and lost the Test series 2–0.\\nAfter cricketThat became Wijesuriya's last international performance. He played a number of matches for Sri Lanka B on Zimbabwe's tour of Sri Lanka in 1987–88, registering six wickets for 102 in a drawn game, but he never played for the senior team. He also appeared in Sri Lankan domestic cricket, playing for Moratuwa Sports Club, where he recorded his best first-class innings bowling figures with 6–51 against Galle in 1989–90, one game for Colombo Cricket Club, and finally one season for Colts Cricket Club in 1993–94.\\n\"}, {'cricketerName': 'Viraj Perera', 'bio': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Intro': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer ', 'From': ' Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  9 June 1978 ', 'Age': '43 years', 'Star sign': 'Gemini', 'paragraph': 'Modara Mehellage Don Pasanna Viraj Perera\\n (born June 9, 1978) in Galle is a Sri Lankan first class cricketer.

He was primarily a specialist batsman, whose best period as a player came from 1982 to 1985.\\nHe is currently the coach of the Oman national cricket team. He was awarded the Deshamanya (Sri Lanka's second-highest national honour) in 1996.\\nEarly yearsHe spent his college life at St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Mendis also captained the Under 20 1st XI side of his college.\\nInternational careerMendis made his debut for Sri Lanka in 1972, batting at number three against the visiting Tamil Nadu side. Mendis top-scored in the first innings with 52, and also made 34 in the second innings, but could not prevent an innings defeat. This match did not have international status, and indeed Mendis represented Sri Lanka in a number of non-internationals. His first ODI, however, came in 1975, when he made 8 against the West Indies in a batting collapse. It took seven more years before Mendis got to play a Test match; on 17 February 1982 he joined forces with the other Sri Lankans against England. In that match, he was sent in to bat at number four, but only made 17 and 27 in Sri Lanka's seven-wicket defeat. More defeats followed, and in his first eight innings he only recorded one fifty, in the first Test of three against Pakistan.\\nHowever, on tour of India in the northern autumn of 1982 he showed his real skill. Sri Lanka had lost two early wickets for 11 runs, and Mendis was sent in to bat with \\nRoy Dias\\n. Their partnership was worth 153 runs, then a third-wicket record for Sri Lanka, and Mendis' maiden century helped Sri Lanka bat out the first day. Then, India amassed 566 for 6 before declaring, leaving Sri Lanka to try to save the draw. Again, the openers fell for single-digit scores, and again Mendis made 105 – which helped Sri Lanka bat until tea on the fifth day. Sri Lanka eventually drew the Test, their first drawn Test series in their history.\\nIn the 1983 Cricket World Cup, Mendis recorded his third One Day International fifty (the previous two came in the 1979 World Cup and on tour to Pakistan in 1982). However, despite a respectable batting average of 25.33, Mendis' fortunes were the reverse of the Sri Lankan side. Sri Lanka lost the games in which he made reasonable scores, while Mendis made a duck in Sri Lanka's only win.\\nMendis recorded a string of poor scores on New Zealand's tour of the island in 1984, only passing 20 once in six Test innings. By this time, however, he was established as the captain of the side, and still picked for the Test match in England that English summer. Mendis made his third Test century as Sri Lanka smashed 491 for 7 batting first amid the rain, and the first Test century by a Sri Lankan captain while in office. Sri Lanka drew that Test. A poor World Series Cup in 1984–85 followed, where Sri Lanka only won one out of ten ODIs, and Mendis was out in single figures four times.\\nThen came the 1985 Indian tour. Mendis led from the front, scoring three fifties and one series-saving century in the third Test, as India were defeated 1–0 in three Tests. After that tour, which also included a drawn ODI series, Mendis' career declined, and by the end of his career it was probably only his captaincy that kept him in. He made two Test fifties in his last ten Tests, and two ODI fifties in his last 32 ODIs following the India tour. \\nRanjan Madugalle\\n replaced him as captain for the very last Test that Mendis played, where he bowed out with a rearguard 56 that was, however, not to be good enough to save a draw. He remained within the Sri Lankan cricketing sphere, however, as he was manager of the successful 1996 Cricket World Cup side.\\nLater on he went on to coach the Oman cricket Team and helped them qualify for their first 2016 World T20 in 2015.\\nDuleep Mendis is the only Sri Lankan cricketer to score a test century in Chennai at MA Chidambaram Stadium and he done it twice in a same test (scoring 105 & 105 in the same test in each innings)\\n\"}, {'cricketerName': 'Roy Dias', 'bio': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Intro': 'Sri Lankan cricketer', 'Is': ' Athlete Cricketer ', 'From': ' Sri Lanka ', 'Type': ' Sports ', 'Gender': 'male', 'Birth': '  18 October 1952, Colombo, Sri Lanka ', 'Age': '69 years', 'Star sign': 'Libra', 'Education': \"    St Peter's College, Colombo     \", 'Sports Teams': '    Sri Lanka national cricket team   Colombo Cricket Club    ', 'Profiles': '      ', 'paragraph': \"\\nRoy Luke Dias\\n (born 18 October 1952) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played Tests and ODIs for Sri Lanka.\\nAn elegant and stylish right-handed batsman he played 20 Test matches and became the first Sri Lankan to hit 1,000 Test runs. He played representative cricket for Sri Lanka from 1979 to 1987 and became the first Sri Lankan test cricketer of any of the three distinct Sri Lankan Tamil groups (Jaffna, eastern and Negombo) in the island.\\nInternational careerWith his 214 runs in the 1979 ICC Trophy he was an integral part of Sri Lanka's tournament victory, as he played four matches with a batting average of 71.33, scoring 214 runs. The victory meant Sri Lanka qualified for the 1979 cricket World Cup, and, surprisingly, Sri Lanka won one match in that tournament as well. Dias made a patient 50 as Sri Lanka made their way to 238 for 5, before bowling India out for a meagre 191.\\nSri Lanka was promoted to Test status three years later, and Dias was picked for the first Test. He had a difficult start, being dismissed for a duck by \\nBob Willis\\n as Sri Lanka fell to 11 for 2, but battled better in the second innings against England's spinners \\nDerek Underwood\\n and \\nJohn Emburey\\n. He made 77, but when he departed and the third wicket fell, Sri Lanka fell apart from 140 for 3 to 175 all out, and England chased 171 to win with relative ease.\\nIndeed, Sri Lanka's first Test matches were promising, but in the end it often ran away from them at crucial moments. An example of this would be Dias' third Test, which was the second Test of three in Pakistan. Batting first, \\nSidath Wettimuny\\n and Dias added 217 for the second wicket, then a Sri Lankan record partnership for any wicket. That enabled Sri Lanka to be on top, leading by 184 on first innings, but they could not bowl out Pakistan and had to settle for a draw. Sri Lanka went on to lose the series 0–2, despite Dias recording a career best 109 in the Third Test.\\nDias continued to make big scores, enjoying a personally good tour of India in September 1982, where he made his only two ODI centuries, with scores of 39, 102 and 121 in the three-match series. However, India won the series 3–0 after relatively convincing victories. Sri Lanka also played a Test match, and Dias made two fifties as he and \\nDuleep Mendis\\n cooperated to draw the match.\\nAt the 1983 Cricket World Cup, Sri Lanka only won one match, and Dias contributed with his only fifty of the series. Pairing up with 80 for the third wicket with \\nBrendon Kuruppu\\n, Dias anchored the chase to 182, ending with 64 not out as Sri Lanka won by three wickets.\\nSri Lanka continually improved, at least in Test cricket, but Dias' career went the other way. He made few big scores in Tests, but he made quite a few fifties in losing causes in ODIs. Then, in September 1985, India came to tour – a tour which was Sri Lanka's biggest success to date. In the first Test, Dias made 4 and 0, yet Sri Lanka dominated thanks to centuries from \\nRanjan Madugalle\\n and \\nArjuna Ranatunga\\n – India, however, survived out the five days and the match ended in a draw. However, in the second Test, Dias came in with the score 109 for 2 and made a stroke-filled 95 to lift Sri Lanka to 385. Then, India were bowled out for 244, and trailing by 141, but Dias scored a quick unbeaten 60 as Sri Lanka declared on 206 for 3, setting India 348 in a day. Despite 78 from \\nKapil Dev\\n, India were bowled out by 198, and Sri Lanka recorded their first Test victory. Dias then recorded his third and last Test century in the third Test, as Dias survived for five hours with \\nDuleep Mendis\\n to save a draw and a series victory.\\nAfter this, Dias' career took a turn for the worse. He only passed 50 in Tests once again – in a drawn Test with India were 1096 runs were scored for the fall of only 17 wickets – and poor form saw him being dropped from the ODI side after the first match in the 1987 cricket World Cup, where he scored 1. He returned for the last match of the 1987 cricket World Cup, the team having played and lost four matches without him, and while his teammates failed to pass 40 he recorded 80 in his last international innings. However, the target of 219 was all too small, and Sri Lanka ended up without a single victory in that World Cup.\\nCoaching careerRoy Dias has served as a coach for the Sri Lanka national cricket team and more recently for the Nepal national cricket team. The coaching of Dias has been instrumental in the success of the Nepali cricket team in different associate cricket tournaments.
